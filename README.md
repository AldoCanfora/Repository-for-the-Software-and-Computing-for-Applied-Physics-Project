A cellular automaton is a discrete model of computation studied in automata theory. 
Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical
biology and microstructure modeling.
A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number
of states, such as on and off. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions.
