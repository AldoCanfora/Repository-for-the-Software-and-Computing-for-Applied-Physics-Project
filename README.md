A cellular automaton is a discrete model of computation studied in automata theory. 
Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical
biology and microstructure modeling.
A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number
of states, such as on and off. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions.
For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood, is defined relative to the specified
cell. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A
new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule (generally,
a mathematical function) that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the
current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. The
rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over
time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously.
